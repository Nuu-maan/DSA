# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

A comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms problems organized by topic and difficulty level.

## Topics

### Stacks
- **Basic**: Fundamental stack operations and applications from GeeksforGeeks
  - Stack implementation with type-safe operations
  - Infix to postfix conversion
  - Next greater element
- **Moderate**: Hard problems from LeetCode
  - Design min stack with O(1) operations
  - Largest rectangle in histogram
  - Basic calculator with parentheses
- **Advanced**: Very hard problems from LeetCode
  - Maximum frequency stack
  - Longest valid parentheses
  - Basic calculator III with advanced operations

## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, then by topic, and further by difficulty level:

```
<Language>/
  <Topic>/
    <Difficulty>/
      questionX.txt
      answerX.py
      README.md
```

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++ 
- **Topics:** Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Hashmaps, Linked Lists, Math, Queues, Recursion, Sorting, Trees, Strings, etc.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Basic, Moderate, Advanced

## ‚úÖ Completed Sections

As of now, the following sections are fully implemented:

- **Python**
  - Arrays (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Dynamic Programming (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Graphs (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Hashmaps (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Linked Lists (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
