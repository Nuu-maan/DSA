# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This project is designed as a comprehensive resource for mastering DSA concepts, preparing for coding interviews, and practicing real-world problems in multiple programming languages.

## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, then by topic, and further by difficulty level:

```
<Language>/
  <Topic>/
    <Difficulty>/
      questionX.txt
      answerX.<language_extension>
      README.md
```

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++ 
- **Topics:** Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Hashmaps, Linked Lists, Math, Queues, Recursion, Searching, Sorting, Stacks, Strings, Trees, etc.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Basic, Moderate, Advanced
