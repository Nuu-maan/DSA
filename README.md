# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This project is designed as a comprehensive resource for mastering DSA concepts, preparing for coding interviews, and practicing real-world problems in multiple programming languages.

## üìö Repository Structure

The repository is organized by programming language, then by topic, and further by difficulty level:

```
<Language>/
  <Topic>/
    <Difficulty>/
      questionX.txt
      answerX.py
      README.md
```

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, C++ 
- **Topics:** Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Graphs, Hashmaps, Linked Lists, Math, Queues, Recursion, Trees, Strings, etc.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Basic, Moderate, Advanced

## ‚úÖ Completed Sections

As of now, the following sections are fully implemented:

- **Python**
  - Arrays (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Dynamic Programming (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Graphs (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Hashmaps (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Linked Lists (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)
  - Math (Basic: GeeksforGeeks, Moderate/Advanced: LeetCode)
  - Queues (Basic: GeeksforGeeks, Moderate/Advanced: LeetCode)
  - Recursion (Basic: GeeksforGeeks, Moderate/Advanced: LeetCode)
  - Searching (Basic, Moderate, Advanced)

Each problem includes:
- A real interview question (with source link)
- A clean, professional Python solution
- Clear file and folder naming for easy navigation

## üöß Coming Soon

- Additional Python topics: Trees, Strings, etc.
- JavaScript and C++ implementations
- More problems and solutions
