# Basic Dynamic Programming Problems

This folder contains basic level dynamic programming problems, their questions, and JavaScript solutions using modern ES6+ features.

## Structure
- Each question is in a separate file: `questionX.txt`
- Each answer is in a separate file: `answerX.js`
- All questions are real interview questions from reputable sources (see links in each question file).

## JavaScript-Specific Features Showcased
- Modern ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator)
- Functional programming patterns (map, reduce, filter)
- Closures and higher-order functions
- Memoization with Map and WeakMap
- Generators for step-by-step algorithm visualization
- Async/await for non-blocking computation
- Performance testing utilities

## How to use
1. Read the problem statement in the corresponding `questionX.txt` file.
2. Review and run the solution in `answerX.js` to see multiple approaches.
3. Practice implementing DP algorithms with modern JavaScript patterns.
