Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have an infinite supply of each of the denominations in coins[], what is the minimum number of coins to make the change?

Example 1:
Input: V = 30, coins[] = {25, 10, 5}
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: V = 11, coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}
Output: 2
