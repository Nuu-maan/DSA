  6. Optimized Bitmask with Backtracking

## Running the Tests

Each solution file includes test cases that can be run using Node.js:

```bash
node answer1.js
node answer2.js
node answer3.js
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Time Complexity**: Most solutions have exponential time complexity due to the nature of backtracking problems.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - Basic backtracking: O(n) for recursion stack
  - Optimized versions: O(nÂ²) for additional data structures
  - Bitmasking can reduce space usage significantly

## Optimization Techniques

1. **Pruning**: Early termination of invalid paths in the search space.
2. **Memoization**: Caching intermediate results to avoid recomputation.
3. **Bitmasking**: Using bitwise operations for efficient state representation.
4. **Heuristics**: Using domain-specific knowledge to guide the search.
5. **Constraint Propagation**: Eliminating impossible values early in the search.

## Common Patterns

1. **Backtracking**: Systematically exploring all possible configurations.
2. **Memoization**: Storing results of expensive function calls.
3. **Bit Manipulation**: Efficiently representing sets of numbers.
4. **Trie Data Structure**: For efficient word search and prefix matching.
5. **Constraint Satisfaction**: Modeling and solving constraint satisfaction problems.

## Next Steps

1. Try to optimize the solutions further.
2. Implement additional test cases to verify edge cases.
3. Visualize the backtracking process for better understanding.
4. Explore parallelization opportunities for performance improvement.
