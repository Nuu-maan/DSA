Longest Palindromic Substring
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/

Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

Example 4:
Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consist of only digits and English letters (lower-case and/or upper-case).

Note: The solution should be case-sensitive.
