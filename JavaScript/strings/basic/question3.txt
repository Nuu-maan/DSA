Longest Common Prefix
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-prefix-using-word-by-word-matching/

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

A common prefix is a string that is a prefix of all strings in the array.

Example 1:
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Example 2:
Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Example 3:
Input: ["interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"]
Output: "inters"

Example 4:
Input: [""]
Output: ""

Note:
- All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.
- The solution should efficiently handle empty arrays and empty strings.
- Consider edge cases with very large input arrays or very long strings.
