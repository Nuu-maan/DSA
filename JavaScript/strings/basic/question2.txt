Check for Anagrams
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-whether-two-strings-are-anagram-of-each-other/

Given two strings, write a function to determine if they are anagrams of each other.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "listen", t = "silent"
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: s = "aacc", t = "ccac"
Output: false

Note:
- You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
- Consider Unicode characters for a more general solution.
- The solution should be case-insensitive.
