Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string/

Given a string, the task is to reverse the order of the words in the given string. 

Example 1:
Input: "i like this program very much"
Output: "much very program this like i"

Example 2:
Input: "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

Note:
- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
- The returned string should only have a single space separating the words.
