# JavaScript Linked Lists

This directory contains comprehensive implementations of linked list data structures and algorithms in JavaScript with multiple ES6+ approaches for each problem.

## Sections

- [Basic](./basic/README.md) - Fundamental linked list operations (GeeksforGeeks problems)
  - Find the Middle of a Linked List
  - Reverse a Linked List
  - Detect Loop in a Linked List
- [Moderate](./moderate/README.md) - Intermediate linked list problems (LeetCode Hard)
  - Merge k Sorted Lists
  - Reverse Nodes in k-Group
  - Copy List with Random Pointer
- [Advanced](./advanced/README.md) - Challenging linked list variants (LeetCode Hard variants)
  - Merge k Sorted Lists with Custom Comparator
  - Reverse Nodes in k-Group with Custom Reversal Logic
  - Copy List with Random Pointer and Metadata

## Features

All implementations use modern ES6+ JavaScript features:

- Arrow functions
- Destructuring
- Spread operator
- Classes for node definitions
- Map and Set data structures
- Functional programming patterns
- Generator functions for algorithm visualization
- Performance testing utilities

## Approach

Each problem is solved with multiple approaches showcasing different algorithms and JavaScript patterns:

- Iterative solutions
- Recursive solutions
- Stack-based approaches
- Functional programming approaches
- Two-pointer techniques
- Generator functions for step-by-step visualization
- Performance comparison utilities

## Testing

Each solution includes comprehensive test cases and performance comparisons. Run any solution file directly with Node.js to see test results:

```bash
# Basic level
node basic/answer1.js
node basic/answer2.js
node basic/answer3.js

# Moderate level
node moderate/answer1.js
node moderate/answer2.js
node moderate/answer3.js

# Advanced level
node advanced/answer1.js
node advanced/answer2.js
node advanced/answer3.js
```
