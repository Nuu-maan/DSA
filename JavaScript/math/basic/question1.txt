Count primes in a range

Given two positive integers L and R, count how many prime numbers exist in the range [L, R] (inclusive).

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Examples:
Input: L = 10, R = 20
Output: 4
Explanation: Prime numbers in range [10, 20] are 11, 13, 17, 19

Input: L = 1, R = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: Prime numbers in range [1, 10] are 2, 3, 5, 7

Constraints:
1 <= L <= R <= 10^6
