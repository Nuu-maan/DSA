Find GCD of an array of numbers

Given an array of positive integers, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the array.

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.

Examples:
Input: arr = [12, 18, 24]
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 is the largest number that divides 12, 18, and 24

Input: arr = [5, 7, 11]
Output: 1
Explanation: 5, 7, and 11 are coprime, so their GCD is 1

Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
