Find LCM of an array of numbers

Given an array of positive integers, find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the numbers in the array.

The least common multiple (LCM) of a set of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of the integers.

Examples:
Input: arr = [12, 18, 24]
Output: 72
Explanation: 72 is the smallest number divisible by 12, 18, and 24

Input: arr = [5, 7, 11]
Output: 385
Explanation: 385 is the smallest number divisible by 5, 7, and 11

Constraints:
1 <= arr.length <= 10^3
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
