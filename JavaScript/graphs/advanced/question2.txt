Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kruskals-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm/

Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph with V vertices and a list of edges (u, v, w), find the weight of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm.

Example 1:
Input: V = 4, edges = [(0,1,10),(0,2,6),(0,3,5),(1,3,15),(2,3,4)]
Output: 19

Example 2:
Input: V = 3, edges = [(0,1,1),(1,2,2),(0,2,3)]
Output: 3

Constraints:
- 1 <= V <= 10^4
- 1 <= E <= (V*(V-1))/2
- 0 <= u, v <= V-1
- 1 <= w <= 10^5

Note: Implement multiple approaches showcasing JavaScript's array methods and ES6+ features.
