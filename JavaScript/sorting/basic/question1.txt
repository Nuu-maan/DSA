Bubble Sort Implementation

Problem: Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Example:
Input: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

Your task is to implement the bubbleSort function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sorted array.
