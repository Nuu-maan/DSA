Insertion Sort Implementation

Problem: Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

Example:
Input: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]

Your task is to implement the insertionSort function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sorted array.
