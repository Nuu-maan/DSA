Selection Sort Implementation

Problem: Implement the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers in ascending order.

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

Example:
Input: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

Your task is to implement the selectionSort function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sorted array.
