Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number-in-a-sorted-array/

Given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.

Input:
- A sorted array arr[] of n-1 distinct integers (1 to n with one missing)

Output:
- Return the missing number

Example:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: 4
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 8 is 4.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10]
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing number from 1 to 10 is 9.

Note: The solution should run in O(log n) time complexity.
