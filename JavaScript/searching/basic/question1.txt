Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/

Given a sorted array of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in the array.

Input:
- A sorted array arr[] of n elements
- An element x to be searched in the array

Output:
- Return the index of x in the array if present, else return -1

Example:
Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40], x = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: Element 10 is present at index 3.

Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40], x = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: Element 5 is not present in the array.

Note: Implement both iterative and recursive solutions.
