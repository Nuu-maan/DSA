🚀 Just completed the JavaScript Searching Algorithms section in my DSA repository! 🎯

🔍 Implemented 9 essential searching algorithms across three difficulty levels with multiple approaches and optimizations:

🧩 Basic Level (GeeksforGeeks):
• Binary Search (iterative/recursive)
• First/Last Occurrences
• Find Missing Number

🎯 Moderate Level (LeetCode Hard):
• Median of Two Sorted Arrays
• Find in Mountain Array
• Split Array Largest Sum

⚡ Advanced Level (LeetCode Very Hard):
• Minimum Window Substring
• Substring with Concatenation of All Words
• Longest Duplicate Substring

💡 Key Features:
• Multiple solution approaches for each problem
• ES6+ features and modern JavaScript patterns
• Comprehensive test cases and edge case coverage
• Performance analysis and optimizations
• Detailed documentation and explanations
