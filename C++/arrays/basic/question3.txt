Find the Kth Smallest Element in an Array

Write a C++ function to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.

Requirements:
1. The function should return the kth smallest element (1-based index)
2. The original array may be modified during the process
3. You may assume that 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length
4. The solution should be efficient (average O(n) time complexity)

Example 1:
Input: [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: The 3rd smallest element is 7

Example 2:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The 1st smallest element is 1

Example 3:
Input: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The 2nd smallest element is still 5
