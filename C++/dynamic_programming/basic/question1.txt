Given an array of integers where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then we cannot move through that element.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 3. Following path is taken: 1 -> 3 -> 8 -> 9

Example 2:
Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 10
Explanation: In every step, we take 1 step to reach the end.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^7
