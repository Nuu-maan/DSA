Problem Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-subsequence-dp-3/

Given an array arr[], find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

Example 1:
Input: arr = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
Output: 4
Explanation: LIS is [2, 3, 7, 101]

Example 2:
Input: arr = [0, 1, 0, 3, 2, 3]
Output: 4

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4
-10^4 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^4
