Given a value V and an array of denominations coins[], find the minimum number of coins that make the value V. If it's not possible to make the change, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: V = 11, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

Example 2:
Input: V = 3, coins = [2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Cannot make 3 using only coin 2.

Constraints:
1 ≤ V ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ number of coin types ≤ 100
