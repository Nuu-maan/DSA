Source: LeetCode (Hard/Very challenging DP)
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/

Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.
- '.' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example:
Input: s = "aab", p = "c*a*b"
Output: true

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 20
- s contains only lowercase English letters.
- p contains only lowercase English letters, '.', and '*'.
