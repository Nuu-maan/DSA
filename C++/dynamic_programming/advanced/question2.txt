Source: LeetCode (Hard)
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/

Implement wildcard pattern matching with support for '?' and '*'.
- '?' Matches any single character.
- '*' Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Example:
Input: s = "adceb", p = "*a*b"
Output: true

Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length, p.length <= 2000
- s contains only lowercase English letters.
- p contains only lowercase English letters, '?' or '*'.
