Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/

Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst balloon i you will get nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right] coins. Here left and right are adjacent indices of i after the burst. After the burst, the left and right then become adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

Example:
Input: nums = [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167
Explanation: nums=[3,1,5,8] -> add 1 at both ends: [1,3,1,5,8,1]
Max coins = 1*3*1 + 1*5*1 + 3*1*5 + 1*8*1 + 1*3*8 = 167

Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 300
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
