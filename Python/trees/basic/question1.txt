Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/

Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Inorder traversal visits nodes in this order: Left subtree → Root → Right subtree

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
Output: [1,3,2]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
