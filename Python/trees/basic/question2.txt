Given a binary tree, find its height (or depth). The height of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest path is 1->2->4 or 1->2->5, both have 3 nodes.

Example 2:
Input: 
    1
     \
      2
       \
        3
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: []
Output: 0

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
