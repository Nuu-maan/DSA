# Basic Trees Problems

This folder contains fundamental tree data structure problems commonly asked in interviews, sourced from GeeksforGeeks. Each problem includes:

- `questionX.txt`: The interview question with a source link
- `answerX.py`: A clean, type-safe Python solution with docstrings and sample usage

## Problems

1. [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](question1.txt) ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-traversals-inorder-preorder-and-postorder/))
2. [Height of Binary Tree](question2.txt) ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-find-the-maximum-depth-or-height-of-a-tree/))
3. [Level Order Traversal](question3.txt) ([GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-tree-traversal/))

## Usage

1. Read the question in `questionX.txt`.
2. Review and run the solution in `answerX.py`.
3. Practice implementing tree algorithms from scratch.
