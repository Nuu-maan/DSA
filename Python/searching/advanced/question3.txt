Problem: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/

Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. The array may contain duplicates. Given the rotated array nums, return the minimum element of this array. You must decrease the overall runtime complexity.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
