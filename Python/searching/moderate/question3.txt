Problem: Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/

The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B. Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs nums[i], nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Here are all the pairs: (1,3) -> 2, (1,1) -> 0, (3,1) -> 2. The 1st smallest distance is 0.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,6,1], k = 3
Output: 5
