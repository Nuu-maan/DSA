Problem: Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.0

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.5
