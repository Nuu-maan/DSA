Problem: Binary Search
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/

Given a sorted array arr[] of n elements and a value x, write a function to search x in arr[].
A simple approach is to do linear search. The time complexity of the simple solution is O(n). Another approach to perform the same task is using Binary Search.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [1, 5, 8, 12, 20], x = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: Element x is present at index 3.

Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], x = 7
Output: -1
Explanation: Element x is not present in arr[].
