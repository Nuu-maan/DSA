Given a sorted array arr[] with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8], x = 8
Output: 7 8
Explanation: 8 occurs first at index 7 and last at index 8.

Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125], x = 5
Output: 2 5
Explanation: 5 occurs first at index 2 and last at index 5.
