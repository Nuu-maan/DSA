Design Hit Counter
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hit-counter/

Problem:
Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes (i.e., past 300 seconds).

Implement the HitCounter class:
- HitCounter() Initializes the object of the hit counter system.
- void hit(int timestamp) Records a hit that happened at timestamp (in seconds). Multiple hits may happen at the same timestamp.
- int getHits(int timestamp) Returns the number of hits in the past 5 minutes from timestamp (i.e., the number of hits that happened in the inclusive range [timestamp - 299, timestamp]).

Sample Input/Output:
Input:
["HitCounter","hit","hit","hit","getHits","hit","getHits","getHits"]
[[],[1],[2],[3],[4],[300],[300],[301]]

Output:
[null,null,null,null,3,null,4,3]
