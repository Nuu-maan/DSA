Number of Recent Calls
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-recent-calls/

Problem:
You have a RecentCounter class that counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the RecentCounter class:
- RecentCounter() Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.
- int ping(int t) Adds a new request at time t (measured in milliseconds), and returns the number of requests that have happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests where t - 3000 <= time <= t.

It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than the previous call.

Sample Input/Output:
Input:
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]

Output:
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]
