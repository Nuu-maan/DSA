Dota2 Senate
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/dota2-senate/

Problem:
In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
The Dota2 senate consists of senators from two parties. Now the senate wants to make a decision. The voting for this decision is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise one of the two rights:
- Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
- Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the Dota2 game.

Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant and the Dire respectively. Then if there are n senators, the round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until only one party has all the senators.

Return a string representing the party that will finally announce victory. If the Radiant wins, return "Radiant". If the Dire wins, return "Dire".

Example:
Input: senate = "RD"
Output: "Radiant"

Input: senate = "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
