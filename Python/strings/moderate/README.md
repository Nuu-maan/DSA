# Moderate (Hard) String Problems

This section contains challenging string problems from LeetCode, focusing on complex string manipulation algorithms and optimization techniques.

## Problems

1. **Minimum Window Substring** (question1.txt, answer1.py)
   - Find the minimum window in a string that contains all characters of another string
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(k)
   - Source: LeetCode Hard

2. **Regular Expression Matching** (question2.txt, answer2.py)
   - Implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'
   - Time Complexity: O(m*n), Space Complexity: O(m*n)
   - Source: LeetCode Hard

3. **Distinct Subsequences** (question3.txt, answer3.py)
   - Count distinct subsequences of one string in another
   - Time Complexity: O(m*n), Space Complexity: O(m*n)
   - Source: LeetCode Hard

## Key Concepts

- Sliding window technique
- Dynamic programming on strings
- Pattern matching algorithms
- State machines and automata
- Space-time complexity trade-offs

## Tips

1. Consider using sliding window for substring problems
2. Use dynamic programming for pattern matching
3. Optimize space usage with rolling arrays
4. Handle edge cases carefully (empty strings, overlapping patterns)
5. Consider using hash tables for character frequency tracking
