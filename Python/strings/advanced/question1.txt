Word Break II

Problem Description:
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Note:
1. The dictionary words can be reused multiple times
2. Return all possible sentences that can be formed
3. The order of words in the dictionary doesn't matter
4. The order of returned sentences doesn't matter

Example 1:
Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]
Explanation: All valid ways to break the string into dictionary words.

Example 2:
Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]
Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.

Example 3:
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: []
Explanation: There is no valid way to break down the string into dictionary words.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 20
- 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
- 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10
- s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters
- All the strings of wordDict are unique
