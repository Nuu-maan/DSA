Longest Common Prefix

Problem Description:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Note:
1. All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z
2. The common prefix must be a prefix of ALL strings in the array
3. Return an empty string if no common prefix exists

Example 1:
Input: ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
Output: "fl"
Explanation: "fl" is the longest prefix common to all strings.

Example 2:
Input: ["dog", "racecar", "car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

Example 3:
Input: ["interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"]
Output: "inters"
Explanation: The longest common prefix is "inters".

Constraints:
- 1 <= strs.length <= 200
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
- strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters
