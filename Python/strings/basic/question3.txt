Check if String is Rotated by Two Places

Problem Description:
Given two strings s1 and s2, write a function to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 by exactly 2 places.
The rotation can be either left or right rotation.

Note:
1. A left rotation by 2 places means removing first 2 characters and adding them at the end
2. A right rotation by 2 places means removing last 2 characters and adding them at the beginning
3. Both strings contain only lowercase English letters

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "amazon", s2 = "azonam"
Output: true
Explanation: "amazon" -> "azonam" (left rotation by 2 places)

Example 2:
Input: s1 = "amazon", s2 = "onamaz"
Output: true
Explanation: "amazon" -> "onamaz" (right rotation by 2 places)

Example 3:
Input: s1 = "geeks", s2 = "eksge"
Output: true
Explanation: "geeks" -> "eksge" (left rotation by 2 places)

Example 4:
Input: s1 = "geeks", s2 = "geeks"
Output: false
Explanation: No rotation by 2 places gives "geeks"

Constraints:
- 1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 100
- Both strings contain only lowercase English letters
- Both strings have equal length
