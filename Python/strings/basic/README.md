# Basic String Problems

This section contains fundamental string manipulation problems from GeeksforGeeks, designed to build a strong foundation in string algorithms.

## Problems

1. **Reverse Words in a String** (question1.txt, answer1.py)
   - Reverse the order of words in a string while preserving whitespace
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)
   - Source: GeeksforGeeks

2. **Longest Common Prefix** (question2.txt, answer2.py)
   - Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings
   - Time Complexity: O(n*m), Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Source: GeeksforGeeks

3. **Check if String is Rotated by Two Places** (question3.txt, answer3.py)
   - Check if a string is a rotation of another string by 2 places
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Source: GeeksforGeeks

## Key Concepts

- String traversal and manipulation
- String comparison techniques
- Basic string algorithms
- Python string methods
- Time and space complexity analysis

## Tips

1. Always handle edge cases (empty strings, single characters)
2. Consider using Python's built-in string methods when appropriate
3. Pay attention to space complexity, especially with string concatenation
4. Test your solution with various input sizes and special characters
5. Consider using string slicing for efficient substring operations
