Letter Case Permutation

Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.
Return a list of all possible strings we could create. You can return the output in any order.

Example:
Input: s = "a1b2"
Output: ["a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2"]
