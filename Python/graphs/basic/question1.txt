Breadth First Search (BFS) of Graph
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/

Given an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list, perform a Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal starting from vertex 0. Return a list containing the order of traversal.

Example 1:
Input: V = 5, adj = [[1,2,3], [0], [0,4], [0], [2]]
Output: 0 1 2 3 4

Example 2:
Input: V = 3, adj = [[1], [0,2], [1]]
Output: 0 1 2
