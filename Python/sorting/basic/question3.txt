Merge Without Extra Space

Given two sorted arrays arr1[] and arr2[] of sizes n and m in non-decreasing order. Merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify arr1 and arr2 so that they contain the first n and last m elements of the merged array respectively.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, m = 5
arr1[] = {1, 3, 5, 7}
arr2[] = {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Output: arr1[] = {0, 1, 2, 3}, arr2[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
