Bubble Sort
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/

Given an array of integers, sort it in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

Example 1:
Input: arr[] = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

Example 2:
Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Reverse an Array in groups of given size

Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array group of size K.

Note: If at any instance, the size of the remaining elements is less than k, then reverse all remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, K = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 3 2 1 5 4
Explanation: First group consists of elements 1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4,5. Last group is reversed.
