Given an array arr[] of positive integers of size N. Reverse every sub-array group of size K.

Note: If at any instance, the size of the remaining elements is less than k, then reverse all remaining elements.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, K = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 3 2 1 5 4
Explanation: First group consists of elements 1, 2, 3. Second group consists of 4,5. Last group is reversed.
