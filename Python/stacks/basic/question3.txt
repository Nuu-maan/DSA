Next Greater Element

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, find the next greater element for each element in the array. The next greater element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. If no such element exists, output -1 for that element.

For example:
- For array [4, 5, 2, 25], the next greater elements are:
  4 --> 5
  5 --> 25
  2 --> 25
  25 --> -1

Use a stack-based approach to solve this problem efficiently.

Input Format:
- First line contains the number of test cases T
- For each test case:
  * First line contains N, the size of array
  * Second line contains N space-separated integers

Output Format:
- For each test case, print N space-separated integers denoting the next greater element for each array element
- If no greater element exists for an element, print -1 for that position

Sample Input:
2
4
4 5 2 25
3
13 7 6

Sample Output:
5 25 25 -1
-1 -1 -1

Constraints:
- 1 <= T <= 100
- 1 <= N <= 10^5
- 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6

Notes:
- The solution should have O(n) time complexity
- Use a stack to track elements and find next greater elements efficiently
- Process elements from right to left for optimal solution
