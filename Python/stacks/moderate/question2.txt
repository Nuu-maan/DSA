Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Problem Description:
Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

For example:
Given heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
The largest rectangle has area = 10 units (formed by height 5 spanning indices 2-3)

Input Format:
heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]

Output Format:
10

Example 1:
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

Example 2:
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: heights = [1,1]
Output: 2

Constraints:
- 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
- 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4

Notes:
- Use a stack to maintain indices of bars
- Process bars left to right
- For each bar, find the first smaller bar on left and right
- Area = height * (right - left - 1)
- Time complexity should be O(n)
- Space complexity should be O(n)
